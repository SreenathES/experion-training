Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially 
long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, 
rather than having to wait until that task has finished.
Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

callback - A callback is just a function that's passed into another function, with the expectation that the callback will be called at the appropriate time.
           callback-based code can get hard to understand when the callback itself has to call functions that accept a callback.
promise - A promise is an object returned by an asynchronous function, which represents the current state of the operation. At the time the promise is returned to the caller,
          the operation often isn't finished, but the promise object provides methods to handle the eventual success or failure of the operation.
          promises are generally one time process.
